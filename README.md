  ## Description
  This program generates encoded or decoded words based on user's input. Users will be prompted to whether they want to either encode or decode the word. Then, users need to provide the word and number of shift. Once users provide those information, this program will output the encoded/decoded words. 
  
  'Encode' direction will force original words to shift towards forward direction, meaning that it will shift in original alphabet direction. For example, if the word 'abcde' is encoded in shift of 5, then the encoded word would be 'fghij'. On the other hand, 'decode' direction will force original words to shift towards reverse direction, meaning that it will shift in reverse of original alphabet direction. For example, if the word 'fghij' is decoded in shift of 5, then the decoded word would be 'abcde'.

The following shows an example of encoded alphabets with shift number of 23:
